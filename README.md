## What is this?

I started reading [_Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230). It includes some exercises which I wanted to track and share with colleagues. Hence this repo :)

Files are named after their respective chapters. Inline comments are used to delineate the individual tasks. All tasks where completed in Javascript.
